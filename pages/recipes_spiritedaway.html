        <h3>Why I Love It</h3>
        <p>Around the age of 6, the sorts of animation I was watching was <em>Spongebob</em>, <em>Pokemon</em>,
        <em>The Rugrats</em>, and prety much anything that was showing on Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, or Disney Channel.</p>
        <p>Witnessing this masterpiece from director Hayao Miyazaki was a drastic departure from anything else I had ever
            experienced before </p>
