        <h3>Why I Love It</h3>
        <p>When I first introduced this film, I completely related to the main character in multiple ways; his name was Alexandros 
            (mine is Alexander), he was a writer and a hermit. I felt drawn to him on a personal level but was also deeply moved
             by the atmosphere of the film.</p>
