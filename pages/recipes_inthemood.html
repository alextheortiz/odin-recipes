        <h3>Why I Love It</h3>
        <p>Heralded by many as one of the greatest films of the century so far, In the Mood for Love changed
            how I viewed storytelling in a fundamental way. Wong Kar-Wai's expert handle of time and place
            transformed my viewing experience from what could've been a simple, passive form of entertainment
            to an examination of love, betrayal, regret, doubt, and everything else in between; such a nuanced
            view of human nature that I cannot stop showering with praise.
